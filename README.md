## About <i>Database-ball</i>
Database-ball provides an interactive way of analyzing all kinds of baseball statistics, from your traditional ones like batting average, home runs, and RBIs, to more advanced ones like slugging, OPS, and OPS+, to an even spicier one I created myself: the Quality/Quantity (QQ) Metric.
  
  
## About the tech
I decided to use [H2O Wave](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/guide) to make this app because of its nice data visualization features. I also liked its functional programming model and thought it would be really fun to use.
